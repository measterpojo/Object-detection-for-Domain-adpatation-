Object detection for Domain adpatation with The Pascal VOC 2012 dataset (DANN)
Goals

To build an object detection model that adapts to a new domain by leveraging labeled data from a source domain and unlabeled data from a target domain. This can improve the model's performance when the target domain has a different distribution of images compared to the source domain.

Source Datasets - The Pascal VOC 2012 dataset is a widely used benchmark in computer vision tasks like object detection, semantic segmentation, and classification. It contains 20 object categories, including animals (e.g., cat, dog, bird), vehicles (e.g., car, bicycle, train), and household items (e.g., chair, sofa, TV)

Target dataset - For the target dataset, we will continue to use the Pascal VOC 2012 dataset. However, we will shift its distribution by altering the color, contrast, brightness, or by adding noise.


GradientReversalLayer

During backpropagation, the GRL multiplies the gradient by a negative scalar. This effectively reverses the gradient's direction, encouraging the model to learn features that are less sensitive to domain-specific variations.


Visualize the results

Since you lack ground truth labels for the target dataset, you cannot calculate metrics like accuracy or mean average precision. You can visualize the results by overlaying the predicted bounding boxes and labels on the images:
